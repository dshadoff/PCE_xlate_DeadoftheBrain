# PCE_xlate_DeadoftheBrain

Dead of the Brain 1 & 2 was the last official game to be released for the PC Engine
in 1999.  Originally released for Japanese PCs such as MSX, FM Towns and PC-98, this
is a visual novel with horror overtones.

This repository holds notes from the translation of Dead of the Brain 1 and will
eventually hold notes from the translation of Dead of the Brain 2, as both games
are included on the PC Engine release.

I started this translation many years ago, and changed approaches several times
along the way.

Notes:
------
'C' files in this repository were originally developed using Eclipse/CDT and the gcc compiler;
Eclipse is no longer required to compile and run the extraction routines.

For any Hu6280 assembler files in this repository, they are intended to be assembled by pceas,
as found in the huc repository of mine.

SQLite3 is also used to hold the script and translation; it is useful due to its flexibility across
multiple platforms and languages.

SQLite Studio was also used for data entry and editing; it's useful not just for these functions, but
also for search capabilities during script edits in the play-test phase.

AdaFruit RP2040 Macropad was used for some formatting; keys were programmed for adding the markup codes,
and also for counting the specific number of characters per line, to allow for hand-formatting of
fixed width font text.
