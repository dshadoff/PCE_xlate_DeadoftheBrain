# PCE_xlate_DeadoftheBrain

Dead of the Brain 1 & 2 was the last official game to be released for the PC Engine
in 1999.  Originally released for Japanese PCs such as MSX, FM Towns and PC-98, this
is a visual novel with horror overtones.

This repository holds notes from the tranlation of both Dead of the Brain 1 and Dead of
the Brain 2, as both games are included on the PC Engine release.

I started this translation many years ago, and changed approaches several times
along the way.

Notes:
------
'C' files in this repository were originally developed using Eclips/CDT and the gcc compiler;
Eclipse is no longer required to compile and run the extraction routines.

For any Hu6280 assembler files in this repository, they are intended to be assembled by pceas,
as found in the huc repository of mine.

SQLite3 is also used to hold the script and translation; it is useful due to its flexibility across
multiple platforms and languages.
